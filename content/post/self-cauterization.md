This is the second example of what I can do. I specifically wrote it to be a little shorter than the first one I did. The story is based on my OC, Illumi #### (an Octoling), but feel free to substitute whoever in there, that's why the name is struck out. It's irrelevant anyway for a drone, no? 121 has an actual name too, but its not important.

I've had the idea in the back of my head for an office hallway liminal space drowning sequence as how someone gets sanitized "mentally". Quite brutal, since you have to feel it! Unless you end up liking it, which isn't that uncommon.

Drone stuff in here, obviously. There's not enough content of the sanitized fellas. Team Order should have won, I take no questions. Tartar should have won more, by the way.

Hey look, it's my first commission! This one's rather simple, but it let me try out some new formatting styles. I really like how it ended up, even if it's not truly 1:1 with the original game. What I'm more proud of is the dialogue, especially considering how much of a stickler I am when it comes to being accurate to the source material.

Commissioner is anonymous, the anon is over 18. So are the Slime Girls, obviously.

## Story below.

~ Debug Mode ~

Look, before I get into this, I just wanted to see what the fuss was about. That's it, that's all I wanted. I played OMORI. Start to finish, front to back. Hell, I'm even starting to get tired of seeing that kid stare at me on the title screen, so I stopped playing the game for a while. That was, until one of my friends sent me a mod.

It was apparently some sort of debug mode. Something to change the events in-game or whatever, see unused dialog, that sort of thing. Of course I was interested, I haven't even seen much of the unused stuff. Who the hell wouldn't be? So, I did as my friend told me to do, merged the files in the game's directory, and launched it. I had a pretty late-game save, right around the end of Humphrey's soul-wrenching puzzle labyrinth. Could probably just load the unused stuff from that one. So, I loaded it, and did the ALT+F5 key combination it wanted me to do for debug mode. I passed out practically instantly.

Before I continue, I want to say that I've been writing this as I go. I started writing it after this happened, so treat this like a diary of some kind... though it kinda didn't work like that. Anyway, DO NOT USE THIS MOD! Please! I can't even make it up that I woke up *inside* of Humphrey! As *Omori!* I was freaked out of my mind! I'll just transcribe what happened afterward. Apparently things here work different now, since the other three were looking at me like I had three heads. I probably did, I don't know.

\[AUBREY]: ...Um, OMORI? Now's really not the time to be spacing out...		

I mentally panicked. They were *reacting* to me! How does that even work?! Yet, I just stood there. I didn't want to ruin things, so I just... stared. Like Omori actually does. It's hard not to react to things, really, especially when you're in a whale's stomach! Had to hold myself together though, I didn't know a way out of this, and nothing I could think of worked. I figured that the only way out of this was to beat the game, which meant I had to... go through... them...

Oh no.

See, let's just say that whoever designed the Slime Girls were definitely trying to provoke something from whoever was playing the game, and who knows why Omori decided to have them in his head. The problem here, is that the save I loaded was right before their fight! How am I supposed to fight like this?! I'm going to lose!

I couldn't throw in the towel yet, though. I have a life to live! I made sure I had everything (wow, this guy has deep pockets), and I stepped forward to where their boss fight began. Of course, it played out as normal (Sweetheart really looks like a brat in 3D, damn); Sweetheart runs away, pins the cost for their work on us, gets eaten, they try to steal Kel and fail, and they start to fight us. See, here's the thing: I was holding back my face being red the *entire* time. The way Molly talks just *sends* me, Marina's utterly terrifying, and Medusa's, well... fuck.

Turns out that was the least of my problems, as we got absolutely bodied during the fight. I had no idea what I was doing, and apparently the other three aren't that good when Omori's not telling them what to do? I don't know. But we lost. And that's where things started to deviate from what was expected, since apparently I stopped being able to hide the blush on my face halfway through said fight.

\[MARINA]: Wow, you all are weak! We didn't even hit you three times!

\[MOLLY]: ...? Oh~ Seems the quiet one can't help it anymore...

And they noticed, too. Great. Aubrey tried to do something by throwing herself in front of me, but it's clear she's only barely standing.

\[AUBREY]: You leave him alone!

\[MOLLY]: ...Fufufu~ Do step aside darling, I don't want to have to disembowel you right now... Besides, he will be fine. As my pet, of course~

She snatched me before I could even move an inch. Yeah, okay, small but powerful, got it. This whole thing was a bad idea. If I get out, I'm killing that friend for screwing me over. The other two tried to get a word in as well, but they were quickly silenced by the sisters.

\[MEDUSA]: I've claimed the pretty one, then... Though, the small one should be taken apart first, dolls.

\[MARINA	]: Yeah yeah, give me a second, I'm trying to tie up this wriggly chick. I'm going to have fun breaking her, heh.

By this point, I was trying to squirm my way out. Being pressed up against some hot squid chick is fun and all until you remember that you're probably going to die sometime soon. But she figured me out, and was quick to squeeze tighter. ...Right against her rack, which made my face even *more* red.

\[MOLLY]: Hey, patience please~ If you want to be eaten so bad, you can always say so...

She seemed to laugh at her own joke. Naturally, I didn't say anything, though I was caught off guard when she slapped some kind of cloth up to my nose. It smelled like some chemical, and though I fought desperately to breathe, I passed out on the spot, much to her delight apparently.

\[MOLLY]: I think you'll be thanking me for this later, darling. Fufufu~

I didn't get to have any dreams. If I did, I don't even remember what they were about. Sometime later though, I woke up. One of my arms was chained to some work table, and I was on the floor. ...And of course, Molly was standing right next to me, working on something I can't see. Though, I was on the floor, so naturally... Damn... she's hot. She heard me, too, given the chain's noises.

\[MOLLY]: Well, you've finally woken up. I thought you would have slept your life away...

I tried to say something, *anything* at this point, but when I tried, nothing happened. Nothing came out. It's like Omori can't speak at all or something. Really not helping things... Okay. Can't handle this. Just going to look off to the side and she's already on top of me damnit.

\[MOLLY]: I don't exactly like it when my pets won't even look at me, you know. Come on, I'm not going to hurt you! ...That much, I think~

I resigned to just shaking my head. I'm not ready for this. As much as I'd want it at some point, I'm just not ready now! A bit disgusted, she got up before returning to her usual smug look. It was only then that I felt a crushing weight on both of my shoulders. Looking around, the other two sisters were holding me down while Molly got back down. Over my dick. What.

\[MARINA]: Hey, don't try to wiggle out of this. Molly's talked you up so much that we all want a turn.

\[MEDUSA]: Oh yes, doll. I've had my time with the pretty one already, so I would like to see how this one reacts.

Not exactly the most enthusiastic about that, but none of them were waiting for any sort of response.

\[MOLLY]: Say, sisters... Why don't we do a little experiment, right now? How does he react to being teased... Fufufu~

\[MARINA]: Heh. I've already gotten bored of mine, so sure.

Medusa just nodded slightly, as if she just wanted what was about to happen to happen already. I just wanted it over with, I still have to go home! ...I don't even know how I can think about going home right now. I wasn't even expecting what was about to happen, which snapped me the hell out of it. Molly, while nearly ripping off my(?) shorts, pulled her top down.

\[MOLLY]: I'm first, darling. Now, hold still~

I didn't even get any time to breathe. She was already on me before I could process what was happening. While I was terrified, my own dick wasn't cooperating. No, it *had* to go straight up. It *had* to go straight up and wedge *itself* between her tits. I'd say "fuck me" but I feel as if that's already happening.

\[MARINA]: And we have to just sit back and wait?

\[MEDUSA]: Don't keep us waiting for too long, doll.

\[MOLLY]: Oh, it won't kill you to wait. I'm not going to take too long, fufufu~

I couldn't help it, okay? I shuddered just enough for my dick to rub slightly between those tits of hers. It was enough for her to notice. ...Great. Slowly and agonizingly teasingly, she moved them. Enough to catch me off guard, but not fast enough to get anywhere. Of course. Can't even think straight.

\[MARINA]: You gonna go any slower? We have things to do, Molly.

\[MOLLY]: You're ruining my fun, darling... Let me get him squirming first~

Medusa was just eyeing the two with some sort of disappointment, all while Molly kept provoking the snake down there, so to speak. Yet they waited for now, all while I just sat here trying to keep my breath steady whilst Molly kept looming over me like that. It wasn't easy, and I was failing at it. Whenever I got any semblance of close though, she'd slow down, and sometimes even stop. It was miserable, but thankfully it only lasted... not that long. I couldn't keep track. Marina eventually interrupted her though, butting in and nearly pushing her off to the side. Molly wasn't happy, but it got her off of my dick. Although, I was not prepared for what Marina was about to do.

\[MARINA]: Okay, enough of you, you've had your turn. We want one now, Molly. So get out of the way!

She went in for it pretty quick. Where Molly was slow and painfully teasing, Marina was fast with no regard to any sort of well being. She had this sort of look on her face as if she was expecting to break a new toy in mere seconds, all whilst Molly was pissed on the side.

\[MARINA]: I'd think I'm good at this! Better than Molly, huh kid?	

It hurt, somewhat. Half of it was pain, half of it was some sort of twisted pleasure. I can tell for a fact that I wouldn't be able to stand well after this was over, much less live if Marina decided to take me for some kind of experiment later. ...Ouch. It didn't take long for Molly to butt in again, which ended up in some odd double titfuck. One going fast, the other still trying to be teasing. How the fuck do I process this?!

\[MOLLY]: Well, I'm certainly not happy that you've suddenly decided that you owned my pet, darling... He's mine, and I'll make sure it stays that way~

\[MARINA]: The look on his face says otherwise.

I couldn't try to cover it up any longer. Yeah, I was starting to lose it. Marina's going fast and Molly's still teasing the right spots. Fuck. Shit. Probably can't keep holding on for that much longer. And of course, I only noticed at the last possible second that Medusa was just about ready to jump in herself.

\[MEDUSA]: I think I'd like a turn now, dolls.		

My heart nearly dropped in fear. The other two are specialized, sure, but Medusa's whole point is perfection. How the hell is she going to play me, oh god. Sure enough, the other two reluctantly moved enough for her to join in, and she did, positioning herself right between the other two, in front of me. It didn't even take her five seconds to get me right back up to the edge, where the others took their time in doing that. She *knew* what she was doing, and she wasn't afraid in doing it. Perfect pace, perfect spots, yet she still seemed half disinterested.

\[MEDUSA]: ...He's rather easy.

\[MOLLY]: Why do you think I wanted to take my time with him...~?

\[MARINA]: We'd be here all day if you did that.

While the three were arguing with each other, I couldn't hold back any more. I finally came. ...Right into the air. Sheesh. It landed on all three of them, and the floor. Molly's smug grin came right back, while the other two looked at me like I came too early.

\[MOLLY]: I told you, darlings~ Now he's all out...	

\[MARINA]: It's not my fault that I break them fast.

\[MEDUSA]: Can you stop arguing, dolls? It's better that this be over with early. We still have things to be doing.

\[MOLLY]: I suppose~

And then he showed up, not too far away. That little hump in the ground, Humphrey. Grotesque to see in person. ...Then again, the whole place is grotesque. I could barely even pay him any mind, I was trying to focus on keeping my head together, much less my breathing intact.

\[HUMPHREY]: Damn right you should stop early! I haven't eaten anything yet! You wouldn't just forget about little old me, would you?

\[MEDUSA]: ...Which of us was meant to feed him today?

\[MARINA]: Don't look at me, I fed him last time!

\[MOLLY]: ...Well, I suppose this pet won't be needing the CLAMs he has~

One by one, they all got up. Molly, of course, robbed me of my hard earned clams I got from abusing the slot machines. That took me hours, great... The other two sisters walked off, whilst Molly just regarded me from where she was standing, readjusting her dress.

\[MOLLY]: Wouldn't you like to go home now? That won't be happening, I'd prefer you stay here... Fufufu~		

Drained from everything that just transpired, I passed out again. I don't know when I woke up, I didn't have a calendar. All I know from then on was that I was stuck with her, as a half test subject and a half personal pet. ...Great. I won't be going home any time soon, just like she said...

I woke up later, in some kind of cage. A small one, like one for a dog. I could barely even move, much to my agony. Looking around, I couldn't see any way out, and Molly was nowhere to be seen. I guess this was supposed to be her bedroom, though, from the looks of it. Well, maybe this life as some kind of pet won't be that bad? I hope. I really hope... I really would prefer not being fed to Humphrey.

## COMMISSION STATUS: `CLOSED`
## CURRENTLY HANDLING: `1/2`

Hello. If you have any questions, or are ready to commission, please ask on Discord. `wistlyr#6900`

Forewarning: I may decide not to do a commission at any point. You will be refunded if you already paid.

* For `0-2k` word stories, I charge `$20`.
* For `2-3k` word stories, I charge `$30`.
* For `3-5k` word stories, I charge `$40`.
* For `5k+` word stories, I charge `$50`.
* If an `OC` is included, an extra `$10` is added, with `$5` for `each subsequent OC`. This doesn't include random background characters.
* If the story is to have multiple chapters or parts, I may offer to discount the subsequent ones.
* If I take special interest in a story premise, I may offer to discount the commission entirely.
* I may put a cap on how long a story can be, depending on the premise.

I am very pedantic on how I write characters. Thus, I may take longer than usual to make sure they are written accurately. If you ask for an OC's story, then I may ask constant questions in an effort to understand them better.

I will write just about any kink, and even SFW, but I will not write anything illegal.

When you commission me, you need not pay until I complete the story. In return, you will only receive up to the "action" of the story as a preview before you pay. If you have a problem with my pricing, please let me know!

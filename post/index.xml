This one&amp;rsquo;s rather simple, but it let me try out some new formatting styles. I really like how it ended up, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not truly 1:1 with the original game. What I&amp;rsquo;m more proud of is the dialogue, especially considering how much of a stickler I am when it comes to being accurate to the source material.
Commissioner is anonymous, the anon is over 18.</description></item><item><title>Self Cauterization</title><link>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/self-cauterization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 01:11:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/self-cauterization/</guid><description>This is the second example of what I can do. I specifically wrote it to be a little shorter than the first one I did. The story is based on my OC, Illumi #### (an Octoling), but feel free to substitute whoever in there, that&amp;rsquo;s why the name is struck out. It&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant anyway for a drone, no? 121 has an actual name too, but its not important.

I love ghost types. Froslass is my favorite ghost type. I really needn&amp;rsquo;t say more.
That said, a content warning for abuse is here. Other than that, mild TF content.

This one&amp;rsquo;s rather simple, but it let me try out some new formatting styles. I really like how it ended up, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not truly 1:1 with the original game. What I&amp;rsquo;m more proud of is the dialogue, especially considering how much of a stickler I am when it comes to being accurate to the source material.
Commissioner is anonymous, the anon is over 18.</description></item><item><title>Commission Manual</title><link>https://watercolor.whistler.page/comm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 02:02:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://watercolor.whistler.page/comm/</guid><description>COMMISSION STATUS: CLOSED TO DO SOON</description></item><item><title>Self Cauterization</title><link>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/self-cauterization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 01:11:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/self-cauterization/</guid><description>This is the second example of what I can do. I specifically wrote it to be a little shorter than the first one I did. The story is based on my OC, Illumi #### (an Octoling), but feel free to substitute whoever in there, that&amp;rsquo;s why the name is struck out. It&amp;rsquo;s irrelevant anyway for a drone, no? 121 has an actual name too, but its not important.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the idea in the back of my head for an office hallway liminal space drowning sequence as how someone gets sanitized &amp;ldquo;mentally&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Frozen Welcomes</title><link>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/frozen-welcomes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 22:11:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://watercolor.whistler.page/post/frozen-welcomes/</guid><description>I made this both as an example of what I&amp;rsquo;m capable of, as well as to fill a woefully underfilled niche: Froslass content. I love ghost types. Froslass is my favorite ghost type. I really needn&amp;rsquo;t say more.
That said, a content warning for abuse is here. Other than that, mild TF content.

WATERCOLOR.WHISTLER.PAGE is my personal repository for my NSFW works. You have to be 18+ to read them.
I will write pretty much anything. As such, you may see kinks here that you consider depraved. Please use the tags to find what you like.
Please be patient for anything new. I am slow to write, and it takes a while for me to progress right now.
You can commission my writing if you want.</description></item></channel></rss>
